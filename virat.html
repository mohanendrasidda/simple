        Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013.Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia.
After a few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19.

Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the limited-overs captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the world. He holds the world record for being the fastest batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000 and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket.

He was given the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri under the sports category in 2017 and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, the highest sporting honour in India, in 2018. Kohli is ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.In 2018, Time magazine named Kohli one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, Kohli was ranked 66th in Forbes list of the top 100 highest paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of $26 million.</p></li>

    <li>  <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a housewife.
         He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhavna.According to his family,
         when he was three-years old, Kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.</li>

    <li>     <p>Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was
          created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake. Kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested
          that "Virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club".Kohli trained at the academy under
           Rajkumar Sharma and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time. Sharma recounts Kohli's early
            days at his academy, "He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was a natural in whatever he did and I was most
             impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot, and I had to literally push him home after the training sessions.
              He just wouldn’t leave." In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.
               Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as "a bright and alert child". Kohli's
               family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.</p></li>

          <li>     <p>Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.Regarding his early life, Kohli has
               said in an interview, "I've seen a lot in life. Losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a
               rented place. There were tough times for the family... It's all embedded in my memory."According to Kohli, his father supported
                his cricket training during his childhood, "My father was my biggest support. He was the one who drove me to practice every day.
                I miss his presence sometimes.</p></li>
